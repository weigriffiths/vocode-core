# What are agents

Vocode Agents are the core component of the Vocode API. Agents can be deployed to receive
phone calls by attaching them to [Numbers](/numbers). Agents can also be used to make outbound calls
via the `calls/create` endpoint.

At its core, the agent is an amalgamation of everything you need to build powerful AI assistants for
your use cases:

- [Prompts](/prompts) – instructions given to the agent that control its behavior.
- [Voices](/voices) – the synthetic voice given to your agent.
- [Webhooks](/webhooks) – mechanism by which you can subscribe to agent events.
- [Conversational Dials](/conversational-dials) – controls for how the agent communicates, like its interruption sensitivity.
- [Actions](/actions) – tools available to your agent, like endint the conversation or transferring the call.

# How to configure an agent

Agents can be configured via our [Dashboard](/dashboard) or via API. As with all of our API objects, Agents have
`list`, `get`, `create`, and `update` endpoints that allow you to manipulate them as you see fit.

In addition to the other API objects enumerated above, agents have other reference fields that can be used to control
agent behavior:

- `language` sets the agent language (for more context see [Multilingual Agents](/multilingual))
- `initial_message` controls the agents first utterance.
- `initial_message_delay` adds a delay to the initial message from when the call begins
- `ask_if_human_present_on_idle` allows the agent to speak when there is more than 15s of silence on the call
- `llm_temperature` controls the behavior of the underlying language model. Values can range from 0 to 1, with higher
  values leading to more diverse and creative results. Lower values generate more consistent outputs.
